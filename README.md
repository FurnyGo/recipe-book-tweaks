# Recipe Book Tweaks
Adds a few vanilla-adjacent QOL tweaks to the recipe book.

This mod is based on [Better Recipe Book](https://github.com/mrshmllow/BetterRecipeBook) by marshmallow. The author is yet to update the mod for 1.19.3, given a lot of mixins have changed.

This mod ports few vanilla-adjacent features to 1.19.3.

### Features

- #### Ungroup recipes
  Grouped recipes (eg. plank varieties) are split into individual recipes. These can be searched like any other recipe.

- #### Disable the bounce effect from newly added recipes
  The subtle bounce animation can be disabled completely.

- #### Unlock all recipes (per-world)
  Unlocks all recipes when a player starts a new world.

- #### Disable the 'New Recipes Unlocked!' toasts
  Completely disables the 'New Recipes Unlocked!' toast. This prevents the rapid firing toasts when all recipes are unlocked.

Some of these features are configurable via [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

    <h3>Personal note</h3>
    <p>This project is my first fabric mod and a personal project since I prefer playing on the latest Minecraft version. Mods take time to be updated. Some mods get discontinued. I took it upon myself to port a mod (at least some parts) I use.</p>
    <p>Please understand most developers do mod development on their spare time so lets not spam them with messages/comments asking for updates. Always check GitHub, CurseForge, Modrinth, Discord etc before asking.</p>
